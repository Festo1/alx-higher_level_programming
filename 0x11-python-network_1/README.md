## Python Network Programming #1: Introduction and Sockets

This project serves as an introduction to network programming using Python. We'll explore the fundamental concepts of socket programming, laying the groundwork for building robust network applications.

**Target Audience:**

This project is designed for Python developers with basic understanding of the language and a desire to venture into network programming. It assumes no prior knowledge of networking concepts.

**Objectives:**

* Understand the basic principles of network communication.
* Master the fundamentals of socket programming in Python.
* Implement client-server communication using TCP and UDP sockets.
* Gain hands-on experience with data transmission and error handling.
* Build a solid foundation for advanced network programming concepts.

**Project Structure:**

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Network Fundamentals:** A concise introduction to network terminology, protocols, and communication models.
2. **Socket Programming Introduction:** A comprehensive overview of sockets, including socket types, addresses, and basic operations.
3. **TCP Sockets:** Hands-on implementation of TCP sockets for reliable client-server communication.
4. **UDP Sockets:** Exploration of UDP sockets for datagram-based communication with its advantages and limitations.
5. **Error Handling:** Techniques for handling errors and exceptions encountered during socket communication.

**Learning Activities:**

* Interactive exercises and code examples within each section.
* Challenge tasks to test your understanding and apply learned concepts.
* Guided explorations of real-world network programming applications.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Set up a Python development environment.
3. Install required libraries (e.g., `socket`).
4. Follow the instructions and examples provided.
5. Practice the exercises and challenge tasks.

**Benefits:**

* Gain valuable practical experience in network programming.
* Develop essential skills for building network applications.
* Enhance your understanding of underlying communication protocols.
* Prepare yourself for further exploration of advanced network programming topics.

**Further Exploration:**

* Implement more advanced socket features like non-blocking I/O and asynchronous programming.
* Explore different data serialization techniques like JSON and Pickle.
* Build a simple chat application using sockets and threading.
* Experiment with network automation tools like Netmiko.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Explain how to fetch internet resources with `urllib` and decode its response.
* Contrast the simplicity of `requests` compared to `urllib`.
* Perform various HTTP requests like GET, POST, and PUT.
* Fetch JSON resources and manipulate retrieved data.

**Resources:**

* **Read or Watch:**
    * HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package
    * Quickstart with Requests package

**Requirements:**

* General
    * Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5
    * All files end with a new line
    * First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
    * Both `README.md` files in root and project folder
    * Code compliant with `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*
    * All files executable
    * File length tested using `wc`
    * Modules with documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    * Access dictionary values with `get` to avoid exceptions
    * Documented modules with meaningful sentences (length verified)
    * Code not executed when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

**Project Structure:**

1. **fetch_urllib.py:** Demonstrates fetching resources with `urllib` and decoding the response.
2. **fetch_requests.py:** Explores using `requests` for simpler HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
3. **fetch_json.py:** Illustrates fetching JSON resources and manipulating data.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Set up a Python 3 development environment.
3. Install required libraries (`urllib`, `requests`).
4. Read the provided resources.
5. Follow the instructions and examples in each script.
6. Complete the challenge tasks within each script.

**Challenge Tasks:**

* Combine `urllib` and `requests` for specific scenarios.
* Implement error handling for potential network issues.
* Build a small application that fetches and processes data from an external API.

**Benefits:**

* Gain valuable experience in web scraping and data manipulation.
* Build essential skills for interacting with web services.
* Enhance your understanding of HTTP requests and responses.
* Prepare yourself for further exploration of web scraping and API integration.
